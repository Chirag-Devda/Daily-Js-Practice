          Elon Reeve Musk (/ˈiːlɒn/ EE-lon; born June 28, 1971) is a businessman
          and investor. He is the founder, chairman, CEO, and CTO of SpaceX;
          angel investor, CEO, product architect and former chairman of Tesla,
          Inc.; owner, chairman and CTO of X Corp.; founder of the Boring
          Company and xAI; co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI; and president of
          the Musk Foundation. He is the wealthiest person in the world, with an
          estimated net worth of US$232 billion as of December 2023, according
          to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and $254 billion according to
          Forbes, primarily from his ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX.[5][6]
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          A member of the wealthy South African Musk family, Elon was born in
          Pretoria and briefly attended the University of Pretoria before
          immigrating to Canada at age 18, acquiring citizenship through his
          Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated at Queen's
          University at Kingston in Canada. Musk later transferred to the
          University of Pennsylvania, and received bachelor's degrees in
          economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend
          Stanford University. However, Musk dropped out after two days and,
          with his brother Kimbal, co-founded online city guide software company
          Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999,
          and, that same year Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged
          with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In October 2002, eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion, and that same
          year, with $100 million of the money he made, Musk founded SpaceX, a
          spaceflight services company. In 2004, he became an early investor in
          electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.). He
          became its chairman and product architect, assuming the position of
          CEO in 2008. In 2006, Musk helped create SolarCity, a solar-energy
          company that was acquired by Tesla in 2016 and became Tesla Energy. In
          2013, he proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation
          system. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial
          intelligence research company. The following year, Musk co-founded
          Neuralink—a neurotechnology company developing brain–computer
          interfaces—and the Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. In
          2022, he acquired Twitter for $44 billion. He subsequently merged the
          company into newly created X Corp. and rebranded the service as X the
          following year. In March 2023, he founded xAI, an artificial
          intelligence company.

          Musk has expressed views that have made him a polarizing figure.[7] He
          has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements,
          including COVID-19 misinformation, and antisemitic conspiracy
          theories.[7][8][9][10] His ownership of Twitter has been similarly
          controversial, being marked by the laying off of a large number of
          employees, an increase in hate speech and misinformation and
          disinformation on the website, as well as changes to Twitter Blue
          verification. In 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
          (SEC) sued him for falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a
          private takeover of Tesla. To settle the case, Musk stepped down as
          the chairman of Tesla and paid a $20 million fine.
